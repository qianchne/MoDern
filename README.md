# MoDern-Cloud: An Artificial Intelligence Cloud for Accelerated NMR Spectroscopy
MoDern-Cloud is a reliable, widely-available, understandable, and ultra-fast reconstruction technique for highly accelerated NMR. This work develops the first cloud-based artificial intelligence platform for multi-dimensional NMR data processing, and is the proof-of-concept demonstration of the effectiveness of merging optimization, deep learning, and cloud computing.
